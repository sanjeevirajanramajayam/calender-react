# 📅 Calendar App (React.js + Node.js)

This is a simple **Calendar App** built using **React.js** for the front-end and **Node.js** for the back-end. The app mimics a Google Calendar-like interface where users can:

- View events in a calendar view
- Create and delete events
- Navigate between different days, weeks, and months
- Event details (name, date, description) placeholders for UI

## 🚀 Features (UI Only)

### Front-End (React.js):
- **Calendar View**: Display a calendar with days, weeks, and months.
- **Event Creation**: A modal or form to simulate event creation (with details like event name, date, and description).
- **Event List**: Display a list of events for the selected day.

### Back-End (Node.js):
- **Express.js API**: Handle routes for event creation, fetching events, and deleting events (currently with mock data).
- **Mock Data**: Use hardcoded data or a mock database (e.g., JSON) for now.

## 📁 Tech Stack

### Front-End:
- **React.js** (for UI)
- **React Router** (for navigation)
- **CSS** or **Styled Components** (for styling)
- **Axios** (for API calls)

### Back-End:
- **Node.js** with **Express.js** (for handling API requests)

## 💡 Purpose

This project aims to create a simple calendar-like interface, providing a clean UI to display and manage events. The back-end can be further developed to integrate with databases like MongoDB or PostgreSQL.
